There are many slimy enemies on your way, but at least you have great music to accompany you and characters with a great sense of humour to meet. Warning: try not to get scammed by a mysterious merchant!"

You've also gained the ability to jump from platform to platform. You can also somehow jump on top of frogs and eagles to make them explode. Remember that famous quote: 'Diamonds are a fox's best friend'. You are going to need it!"
